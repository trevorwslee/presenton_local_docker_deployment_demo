# Presenton Local Docker Deployment Demo

This is simply a demo of the LLM-powered presentation slides generation tool [Presenton](https://github.com/presenton/presenton)

The demo will be targeted to show audience:
* Deployment of Presenton locally using Docker, specifically Docker Desktop.
* Hooking up Presenton with [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) LLM gateway for using selected model on a pay-as-you-go basis.
  For the OpenRouter service, you certainly need to setup and account and have enough credits (a little as $10 US) to use the service.
* Hooking up Presenton with [Pixabay API](https://pixabay.com/service/about/api/) for image sourcing.
